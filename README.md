# Fake News Classification

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on fake news classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) algorithms. The objective of this project is to develop models that can distinguish between fake and real news articles, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.

Fake news has become a major concern in today's digital age, where information spreads rapidly through social media and online platforms. By leveraging NLP techniques and ML/DL algorithms, we can analyze the textual content of news articles and identify patterns that differentiate between genuine and fabricated information.

The notebook showcases the following:
- Preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLP techniques.
- Implementation of ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for fake news classification.
- Implementation of DL algorithms such as Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for more advanced fake news detection.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
